# AI Assistance Prompts

AI tools were used only as a small support during development, mainly for fixing errors, understanding issues, and improving documentation clarity. The main project idea, architecture, settlement algorithm, and most of the implementation were done independently. Below is a realistic log of the limited prompts used during the development process.

---

## Initial Setup

1. "Suggest a simple folder structure for a Go backend with a React frontend."
2. "Explain the purpose of handler, service, and repository layers in a Go project."

---

## Debugging & Error Fixes

3. "The Vite frontend build is failing — what could be the possible reasons?"
4. "My React app is showing a blank white screen. How do I debug console errors?"
5. "How can I fix CORS issues between my Go backend and React frontend?"
6. "API calls are not returning data correctly — help me check possible mistakes."
7. "Sidebar navigation is not working properly. Suggest how to fix routing issues."
8. "Settings page buttons are not responding — what could be causing this?"

---

## Minor Feature Guidance

9. "Suggest a simple way to add charts using Recharts in React."
10. "How can I improve the UI layout for displaying settlement results?"

---

## Documentation & Cleanup

11. "Help me organize README sections clearly."
12. "Suggest how to clean unused files and keep the repository structured."

These prompts reflect small assistance taken for troubleshooting and minor improvements. The overall system design, business logic, and implementation were carried out independently.
